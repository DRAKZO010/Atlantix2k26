🚀 Setup & Deployment
1. Local Setup
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atlantix-2k26.git

Create a config.js file in the root directory.

Add your window.env object with your Firebase and EmailJS credentials.

Open index.html using a local server (like VS Code Live Server).

2. Firebase Rules
Ensure your Firestore rules permit reading and writing to the registrations collection for the scanner to function:

JavaScript

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /registrations/{registrationId} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
3. Deployment (Render/Netlify)
This project is optimized for deployment as a Static Site.

Security: Since config.js is ignored by Git, you must add your keys (e.g., FIREBASE_API_KEY) as Environment Variables in your hosting provider's dashboard.

📱 Using the Scanner
The scanning tool is located at /scanner.html.

Open the URL on a mobile device at the event gate.

Grant camera permissions.

Scan a participant's QR code.

The system will verify the ID and instantly update the "Checked-In" status in Firebase.

🎨 Design System
Typography: Orbitron (Headings) & Rajdhani (Body).

Colors: Primary Teal (#218085) with professional Dark/Cream variants.

Responsive: Mobile-first approach, fully functional on all screen sizes.
